## About it:

Spam Analyzer is a web app based on _Machine learning for filtering out spam in the message._ To build the spam analyzer model, I used the dataset name ` SMS Spam Collection Dataset` available on Kaggle. This model has an accuracy of 97%.

**Directory Structure:**



## Model Building:

- I preprocessed the dataset which has 5572 rows.
- After that I performed data visualization to get a better understanding of the dataset.
-  I've labeled(`del.Ham` and `spam`) all the rows to make a prediction.
-  I used `nltk.corpus` stopwords and Multimodal Naive Bayes Classifier to build the model.

## Building End-to-end Application

To build the end-to-end **Spam Analyzer**:
- Used `Flask` to build backend of the application.
- Used `HTML+CSS` to build the frontend of the application.
- Used `Heroku` to host the web application.
